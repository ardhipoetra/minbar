GPrayer is a GNOME Islamic prayer times application on top of libitl,
the Arabeyes prayer calculation library.

It runs in background as a tray icon, plays the 'athan' (call to
prayer) and notifies when at prayer times.

GPrayer works with the main calculation methods (Muslim League by
default, Shafii, Hanafi, ...).
