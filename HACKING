STYLE
-----
Indenting
    Use 4 spaces. 

Indent style
    All brackets should be on their own lines. Example:
        
    void function()
    {
        int i = 1;
        if(i)
        {
            do();
        }
        else
        {
            dont();
        }
    }

Line Width
    100 Maximum, but I usually use 80.
    in vim, I use :match DIffAdd "\%80c.*" to highlight lines longer than 80 lines, like this one.


CODING
------
Functions
    All functions should be declared first, then defined. 

Glade Interfaces
    Use Glade 3.0 or above to edit the glade user interface files.
    Avoid using glade 2.0 at all cost. Load the xml files at run
    time, no need to "build".

Widgets
    Windows: Don't destroy them, just hide them! if the code needs to
    destroy the window, fix it. If absolutly necessary, please ask first,
    as other code my rely on widgets existing.
